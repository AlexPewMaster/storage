hello, this is a document about installing prism launcher and setting up a new instance for minecraft fabric!
you're probably wondering: "what's the purpose of doing this?" well, it has a lot of stuff that generally improves the minecraft experience.

1. installing prism launcher and setting it up
 1. go to https://prismlauncher.org and download the newest version for your os
 2. follow the instructions in the installer
 3. if the installation is done, open the prism launcher
 4. choose your language (english is highly recommended)
 5. select java 17 from the list (if you don't have the option to select java 17, you need to download it at https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/ )

2. adding your minecraft account to the prism launcher
 1. click on the accounts tab at the top right of the launcher
 2. select "manage accounts"
 3. click "add microsoft account" or "add mojang account" (if you migrated your account already, select the first option)
 4. follow the instructions on screen

3. creating a brand new instance of minecraft fabric
 1. click "add instance" at the top left of the launcher
 2. select "vanilla" at the left list
 3. name your instance and create a new group if you want to (you can change this later of course)
 4. select "fabric" on the mod loader list and then select the fabric loader version 0.14.14
 5. click on "create"

4. (optional) migrating all of your minecraft worlds, texturepacks and other things to the new instance
 1. locate your original .minecraft folder (usually in your /appdata/roaming folder)
 2. right click on your instance in the prism launcher and click "folder"
 3. copy the whole .minecraft folder to the instance folder
 4. (optional but not recommended) delete the old .minecraft folder

5. adding new mods to the fabric instance
 note: before adding new mods, check if they're client-side or server-side (you can check that by going to https://modrinth.com/mods/ and searching for the mod there). i highly recommend you to only install client-side mods.
 1. right click on your instance in the prism launcher and click "edit"
 2. select the "mods" tab
 3. select the "download mods" button at the top right
 4. select modrinth for your mod provider (if you cant find the mod you're looking for, try searching on curseforge instead)
 5. search for the mods you're looking for and select "select mod for download" (make sure you're installing the correct version of the mod)
 6. if you're done looking for mods and selecting them, click on "review and confirm" and check if everything looks alright
 7. finally, click "download"

6. testing if your instance is working
 1. select your instance and click "launch"
 2. see if minecraft is starting and working fine
 3. create a new test world to see if your minecraft crashes

if your minecraft doesn't crash, that's a great sign! you did every step correctly and can now play with mods!
